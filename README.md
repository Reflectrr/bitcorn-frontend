# Bitcorn-frontend
This is the client-side of the Bitcorn project. It is a responsive, mobile-friendly website written in React that displays the prices for Bitcoin in the past as well as attempting to make a prediction for the next dayâ€™s close price.

Curious about the server for this project? Please visit the [bitcorn-backend](https://github.com/reflectrr/bitcorn-backend/) repo. Thanks!

# Credit
I'd like to say "thank you" to my friend Samuel Jin for experimenting with the bitcoin data and coming up with a reasonably working machine learning model, as well as for coming up with this creative name, Bitcorn, for the project. This project is nothing without you.
